With Window Saver you can enable monitoring on specific windows. Having a window to be monitored will keep it state saved on chrome storage (it will be synced automatically!). You can close it and use Window Saver to reopen a monitored window later. You can also set the new for a specific window so it will be easy to find your windows.

It will also save the size/position of the window, so you can have them on the same position.

Features:
- Monitor Windows tabs, size and position to chrome storage
- Restore closed monitored Windows
- Add names to Windows for organization
